# Database Setup and Explanation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the `database.py` setup in this project. It covers every step, the purpose behind each line, and answers all the questions you might have about the database initialization and session management using SQLAlchemy.

---

## Overview

The `database.py` file is responsible for initializing the database connection, managing sessions, and providing utilities to create tables and interact with the database using SQLAlchemy ORM. This setup is essential for any application that needs to persist and retrieve data from a relational database.

---

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Importing Required Modules

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from core.config import settings
```

- **`create_engine`**: This function creates a new SQLAlchemy Engine instance, which is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application. The engine manages the connection pool to the database and is used to execute SQL queries.
- **`sessionmaker`**: This is a factory for creating new `Session` objects. Sessions are used to interact with the database in a transactional scope (i.e., they manage the context for database operations).
- **`declarative_base`**: This function returns a base class for all ORM models. All your database models should inherit from this base class so that SQLAlchemy can keep track of them and map them to database tables.
- **`settings`**: This is typically a configuration object that holds environment variables, including the database URL. It is imported from your project's config module.

---

### 2. Creating the Database Engine

```python
engine = create_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)
```

- **What is `create_engine`?**
  - `create_engine` creates a connection pool to the database specified by `settings.DATABASE_URL`. It acts as a central point through which all SQL queries are sent to the database. The engine does not actually connect to the database until it is first used.
- **Purpose:**
  - To establish a reusable, efficient connection to the database for the entire application.

---

### 3. Configuring the Session Factory

```python
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
```

- **What is `sessionmaker`?**
  - `sessionmaker` is a factory for creating new `Session` objects. Each session manages the conversations with the database and is used for all ORM operations.
- **Parameters:**
  - `autocommit=False`: Disables automatic commits. You must explicitly commit transactions, which gives you more control and helps prevent accidental data loss.
  - `autoflush=False`: Disables automatic flushing of changes to the database. You must explicitly flush or commit, which can help with performance and debugging.
  - `bind=engine`: Associates the session with the previously created engine, so all sessions use the same database connection pool.
- **Purpose:**
  - To provide a consistent way to create new database sessions for each request or operation, ensuring thread safety and proper resource management.

---

### 4. Defining the Declarative Base

```python
Base = declarative_base()
```

- **What is `declarative_base`?**
  - `declarative_base` returns a base class that all ORM models must inherit from. This base class keeps track of all subclasses (i.e., your models) and their mappings to database tables.
- **Why do all models need to inherit from this?**
  - Inheriting from `Base` allows SQLAlchemy to automatically map your Python classes to database tables and manage their metadata. Without this, SQLAlchemy would not know how to create or interact with your tables.
- **Purpose:**
  - To enable the ORM features of SQLAlchemy, such as automatic table creation and object-relational mapping.

---

### 5. Database Session Dependency

```python
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close() # when program ends we close the session or connection to db
```

- **What does this function do?**
  - `get_db` is a generator function that provides a database session to the caller (often used as a dependency in FastAPI routes). It ensures that a new session is created for each request and is properly closed after use.
- **Line-by-line explanation:**
  - `db = SessionLocal()`: Creates a new session instance.
  - `try: yield db`: Yields the session to the caller, allowing them to interact with the database.
  - `finally: db.close()`: Ensures the session is closed after use, releasing the connection back to the pool and preventing resource leaks.
- **Purpose:**
  - To manage the lifecycle of database sessions, ensuring that each session is properly closed and that there are no dangling connections.

---

### 6. Creating Database Tables

```python
def create_tables():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

- **Why do we need this?**
  - `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` tells SQLAlchemy to create all tables in the database that are defined by models inheriting from `Base`. This is typically called once during application startup or migration.
- **Purpose:**
  - To ensure that all necessary tables exist in the database before the application starts using them. This is especially useful during development or when setting up a new environment.

## Summary Table

| Component         | Purpose                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create_engine`   | Establishes a connection pool to the database.                                          |
| `sessionmaker`    | Factory for creating new database sessions.                                             |
| `declarative_base`| Base class for all ORM models, enabling table mapping and metadata management.          |
| `get_db`          | Dependency function to provide and manage database sessions per request.                |
| `create_tables`   | Utility to create all tables defined by ORM models in the database.                     |

## Best Practices

- Always close sessions after use to prevent connection leaks.
- Use `get_db` as a dependency in your API routes to ensure proper session management.
- Call `create_tables()` only during initial setup or migrations, not on every application start in production.
- Keep your database URL and credentials secure, ideally in environment variables or a config file.
